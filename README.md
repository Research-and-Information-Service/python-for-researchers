# Python for Researchers

This repo contains written resources for learning Python with a focus on data analysis and data science. There are worked examples and exercises to complete in most chapters. 

## Contents

* [C1 - An Introduction to Python](https://github.com/Research-and-Information-Service/python-for-researchers/blob/main/C1%20-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Python.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook covers the basics of Python including basic arithmetic including arithmetic operators (addition, subraction, multiplication, division, etc); variable assignment; scientific mathematical functions; variable types; and type conversion. There are numerous worked examples and exercises for readers to complete and gain practical experience of the programming language. 

* [C2 - Functions](https://github.com/Research-and-Information-Service/python-for-researchers/blob/main/C2%20-%20Functions.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook covers the basics of functions in Python including both in-built functions and custom functions. It details how to write and call custom functions as well as how to use the return statement. 

* [C3 - Methods](https://github.com/Research-and-Information-Service/python-for-researchers/blob/main/C3%20-%20Methods.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook covers the basics of methods in Python. Objects within Python has associated 'methods' for instance list type objects can be sorted and manipulated using the append() and sort() methods. There are worked examples and exercises to complete.

* [C4 - Flow control statements](https://github.com/Research-and-Information-Service/python-for-researchers/blob/main/C4%20-%20Flow%20control%20statements.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook details flow control including 'if elif else' statements, 'for loops' and 'while loops'. 

## Contributions

It is intended that further chapters be added detailing a range of topics from basics such as for loops and if/else statements to more complex areas including using APIs, web scraping, the use of statistics and introductory machine learning.
